# NLP Text Processing Pipeline

A comprehensive pipeline for text processing, feature extraction, and semantic analysis using TF-IDF and Word2Vec.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete NLP workflow that:
1. Processes raw text documents
2. Computes TF-IDF weights
3. Trains Word2Vec embeddings
4. Performs semantic similarity analysis
5. Generates document-level scores based on seed words

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**:
  - Punctuation removal
  - Stopword filtering
  - Document cleaning

- **Feature Extraction**:
  - TF-IDF vectorization
  - Word2Vec embedding training
  - Vocabulary management

- **Semantic Analysis**:
  - Seed word expansion
  - Word similarity calculations
  - Document scoring
